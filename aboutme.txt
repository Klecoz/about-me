"About Me" Content Questions
Describe yourself in two to three sentences.

I'm currently working at Resurgence Brewing Co. as the kitchen lead. I also manage our wordpress-based website.

What's important to you?
I really do like learning. Becoming a developer is important to me, because I really would like to stop working in resturaunt jobs.

Where are you from?
I grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. But I moved to buffalo in October 2013.

What are your favorite hobbies?
I enjoy playing games! I'm currently playing Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for the 3DS.

What's your dream job?
I really would love getting a job as a Front End Developer, and eventually progress into a Full-Stack Developer. I used to think that my dream job would be in video when I was in college, but I decided against it. It was great learning about it, but I didn't want to spend the next 5 years of my life holding a boom-mic.

What music have you been listening to lately?
I've currently been listening to The Spinto Band's "Nice and Nicely Done" album on a regular basis. I saw them during the summer of 2013 at Brooklyn Bowl. I was listening to them before that, but it was still really exciting!

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently the Kitchen Lead at Resurgence Brewing Company, a new brewery that just opened June 2014. It's almost been a year since I've worked there. I'm also a Certified Beer Server as of April 13th 2015.</p>
      <p>I started learning HTML when I was around 11 or 12, and made my first website back when Homestead.com was still around. Since then, I've kinda jumped around and experimented with different subjects. For some reason, I always come back to learning web design/development! I went to SUNY Fredonia for a degree in Video Production but I'm currently taking a break to pursue other interests. I'm hoping to enroll back into another SUNY school late 2015/early 2016.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
    <p> I grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. It's a place of continuous change, and I still go back from time to time. It's seriously a really nice place now, but I can't really afford to live on my own there with skyrocketing rents. I moved to Buffalo, NY and been here since October 2013.</p>

      <h1>More about me</h1>


      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>I'm an avid gamer! I'm currently neck-deep into Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for the 3DS!</p>

      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>I really would love getting a job as a Front End Developer, and eventually progress into a Full-Stack Developer. I used to think that my dream job would be in video when I was in college, but I decided against it. It was great learning about it, but I didn't want to spend the next 5 years of my life holding a boom-mic.</p>

      <h2>What's your background?</h2>
      <p>I was studying Video Production in college, but I kinda started from a basic computer/programming background. I was a Computer Science 'Major' in High School, so I learned about all the basic programming essentials through BASIC, C++, and Java. I'm surprised that I didn't continue with it. I guess that I just needed something different to do for a while.</p>

      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
      <p>I've currently been listening to The Spinto Band's "Nice and Nicely Done" album on a regular basis. I saw them during the summer of 2013 at Brooklyn Bowl. I was listening to them before that, but it was still really exciting!</p>
